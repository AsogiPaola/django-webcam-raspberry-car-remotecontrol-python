# django-webcam-raspberry-car-remotecontrol-python
In this project I mainly used the Python language, since I worked on a Raspberry Pi 4, here I implemented Django to use a local IP in the project, the car used is from Yahmboom, which has some pre-established codes, and has a camera , motors, servomotors, ultrasound sensor, and of course the raspberry.

This is the index.html page that contains 4 main sections, the home, the camera, the remote control and a footer, since it is a personal project, it does not have real information, and the html is a template edited with images of the internet, without any objective beyond research.

This is the viewing section through the camera that is connected to the raspberry, it can be seen from the website, this part is specified in views.py
