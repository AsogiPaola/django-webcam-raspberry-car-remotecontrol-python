# django-webcam-raspberry-car-remotecontrol-python
In this project I mainly used the Python language, since I worked on a Raspberry Pi 4, here I implemented Django to use a local IP in the project, the car used is from Yahmboom, which has some pre-established codes, and has a camera , motors, servomotors, ultrasound sensor, and of course the raspberry.
